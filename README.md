This directory contains the following Applications :
1- Angular App.
2- Node JS APP.


To set up the Angular App follows these steps:

1- Install Angular CLI globally, if you are asking for any specific version so I must suggest you to use Angular CLI: 1.7.4. 
2- Move in the news-app-assignment/news-app directory and after opening terminal run command 'sudo npm install'. 
   I would suggest you clean your npm cache as well to avoid exceptions before npm command, for this run command 'sudo npm cache clean -f'.
3- Once you are done installing packages, run command 'npm start' to run Angular server.


To setup the Node JS App follows these steps:

1- Install Node globally, if you are asking for any specific version so I must suggest you use Node: 8.9.0.
2- Move in the news-app-assignment/news-app-api directory and after opening terminal run command 'sudo npm install'. 
   I would suggest you clean your npm cache as well to avoid exceptions before npm command, for this run command 'sudo npm cache clean -f'.
3- Once you are done installing packages, run command 'npm start' to run the Node server.
